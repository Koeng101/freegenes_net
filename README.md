Abstract:

DNA distribution networks are inefficient, expensive, and inclusive. This makes hinders widespread collaboration and gatekeeps the synthetic biology community. We present a new kind of distribution network that leverages marginal costs of reproduction of biological materials and wide shipping networks. Widespread distribution of static biological materials allows for distributed validation and experimentation while drastically lowering costs for new people to enter the field. 

## Overview

Currently, DNA material is mostly distributed through informal networks or centralized organizations. These informal networks are often highly dependent on "who you know", while the centralized organizations are slow to adapt to changes in the field and have unintentionally created material monopolies.

The scope of the FreeGenes Network is small. The goal of the FreeGenes Network is to implement a method for widespread distribution of physical biological materials (such as plasmid DNA or strains), while remaining agnostic to form of distribution and annotation of those materials. 

There are 4 important parts of the FreeGenes Network:
- Blocks, which are unit of physical material distributed through the FreeGenes Network. For example, a 384-well plate of dried plasmid DNA could be a block. Blocks which are identical to each other are part of a Block Group. Each Block Group has a finite number of Blocks that can be spread throughout the network.
- Hosts, which are organizations that can validate and optionally produce Blocks for the FreeGenes Network. Hosts are crucial in ensuring quality control within the network, and so must be willing to verify the integrity of blocks. Hosts which create new Blocks distribute them throughout the network, where it is up to other Hosts whether or not those Blocks should be distributed downstream. For example, other Hosts could reject Blocks because they contain illegal genetic material.
- Distributors, which are organizations that can distribute Blocks for the FreeGenes Network. Hosts do not need to be Distributors and Distributors do not need to be Hosts. Hosts will often be Distributors, but most Distributors will be downstream from Hosts, simply receiving and forwarding Blocks throughout the network.
- Users, who are the people at the edges of the network that actually use the Blocks to do things.

The FreeGenes Network is designed to get as many Blocks into the hands of as many Users as possible, while ensuring that Blocks faithfully deliver their materials.
